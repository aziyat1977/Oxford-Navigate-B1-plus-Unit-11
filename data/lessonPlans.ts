Step 2: Run a TTT cycle: students try the target language first, you diagnose, then teach only the gaps, then re-test for visible progress (TTT structure). Step 3: Embed TBL: after accuracy work, students complete a meaning-focused outcome task (podcast/newsroom roleplay) using the target language, with a short planning + report stage. Step 4: Teach the core grammar as “third/unreal past conditional”: If + past perfect → would have + past participle (plus might/could for weaker certainty). Step 5: Keep it teen-simple: micro-instructions, short bursts, constant pair work, and funny ‘illegal-but-silly’ fictional scenarios (no real-world harmful instruction). Step 6: Spiral vocab (crime words) across reading, listening-style gaps, and roleplays, so every word is met 4–6 times in different formats.",
